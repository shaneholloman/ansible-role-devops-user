# When installing packages during later steps, the Fedora Docker
# images we are using can throw sporadic errors like: "No such file or
# directory: '/var/cache/dnf/metadata_lock.pid'".
#
# The fix is to ensure that systemd finishes initializing before
# continuing on to the converge tasks.  For details see:
